A lightweight package for fast, GPU-accelerated computation of gradients and Hessians of functions constructed via composition.

## Statement of Need
Deep neural networks (DNNs) and other composition-based models have become a staple of data science, garnering state-of-the-art results and gaining widespread use in the scientific community, particularly as surrogate models to replace expensive computations. The unrivaled universality and success of DNNs is due, in part, to the convenience of automatic differentiation (AD) which enables users to compute derivatives of complex functions without an explicit formula. Despite being a powerful tool to compute first-order derivatives (gradients), AD encounters computational obstacles when computing second-order derivatives (Hessians).  

Knowledge of second-order derivatives is paramount in many growing fields and can provide insight into the optimization problem solved to build a good model. Hessians are notoriously challenging to compute efficiently with AD and cumbersome to derive and debug analytically.  Hence, many algorithms approximate Hessian information, resulting in suboptimal performance.  To address these challenges, `hessQuik` computes Hessians analytically and efficiently with an implementation that is accelerated on GPUs.

## Installation

From PyPI:
```console
pip install hessQuik
```

From Github:
```console
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/elizabethnewman/hessQuik.git
```

### Dependencies
These dependencies are installed automatically with ```pip```.
* torch (recommended version >= 1.10.0, but code will run with version >= 1.5.0)

## Getting Started

Once you have installed hessQuik, you can import as follows:

```python
import hessQuik.activations as act
import hessQuik.layers as lay
import hessQuik.networks as net
```

You can construct a hessQuik network from layers as follows:
```python
d = 10 # dimension of the input features
widths = [32, 64] # hidden channel dimensions
f = net.NN(lay.singleLayer(d, widths[0], act.antiTanhActivation()), 
           lay.resnetLayer(widths[0], h=1.0, act.softplusActivation()),
           lay.singleLayer(widths[0], widths[1], act.quadraticActivation())
           )
```

You can obtain gradients and Hessians via
```python
nex = 20 # number of examples
x = torch.randn(nex, d)
fx, dfx, d2fx = f(x, do_gradient=True, do_Hessian=True)
```

### Support for Laplacians and Directional Derivatives

If you only require Laplacians, not full Hessians, you can obtain the gradients and Laplacians via
```python
fx, dfx, lapfd2x = f(x, do_gradient=True, do_Laplacian=True)
```

If you only require evaluations of the Jacobian and Hessian along certain directions, you can provide the directions in `forward_mode` via
```python
k = 3  # number of directions
v = torch.randn(k, d)
fx, vdfx, vd2fxv = f(x, do_gradient=True, do_Hessian=True, v=v, forward_mode=True)
```
and in `backward_mode` via
```python
m = widths[-1]  # dimension of output features
v = torch.randn(m, k)
fx, dfxv, d2fxv = f(x, do_gradient=True, do_Hessian=True, v=v, forward_mode=False)
```

Some important notes:
* To use this functionality, you must install from github.
* Currently, this functionality is only supported for `singleLayer`, `resnetLayer`, and networks using only these types of layers, including `fullyConnectedNN` and `resnetNN`.
* If `do_Hessian=True`, then the full Hessian will be computed, even if `do_Laplacian=True` as well.
* Laplacians can only be computed in forward mode.  Hence, if `do_Laplacian=True` and full Hessians are not requested, `hessQuik` will compute derivatives with `forward_mode=True` automatically.
* For evaluating of derivatives along certain directions, the user must specify the mode of differentiation.  Currently, this choice is not automated.
